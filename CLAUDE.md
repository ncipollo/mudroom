# Mudroom

## After Each Change
Run the following commands after every code change and fix any issues before considering the change complete:

1. `cargo fmt` - Format all code
2. `cargo test` - Run all tests
3. `cargo clippy` - Run linter; fix all warnings and errors before completing the change

## Dependencies
Always use exact versions for dependencies in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `"4.5.60"` not `"4"`). Check `Cargo.lock` for the resolved version when pinning.

## Module Conventions
Never use `mod.rs`. Always use the modern Rust style: create a top-level file (e.g., `foo.rs`) as the module root, and a matching folder (`foo/`) for any submodules.
